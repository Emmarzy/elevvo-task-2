# Elevvo Internship - Task 2

## Data Requirements
- **Dataset:** `Mall_Customers.csv`
- **Expected local path:** place the file at workspace root so notebook paths resolve (for example `../../Mall_Customers.csv` from this task folder).

## Repository Data Policy
- Do **not** commit large/raw dataset files unless required.
- Keep notebooks/code in repo, and document where data comes from.
- For public sharing, add only tiny sample data if needed.

## Quick Setup
1. Download/obtain `Mall_Customers.csv`.
2. Place it in the project root (`Machine Learning Track/`).
3. Run `Task_2_Solution.ipynb`.
